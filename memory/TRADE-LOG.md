**Status:** CRITICAL — Remote agent could not access API credentials

No `.env` file found in project root. API credentials unavailable; stop placement aborted.

**Manual action required:**
1. Confirm SLB fill: `bash scripts/alpaca.sh positions` — look for SLB, note filled_avg_price

   ```
   bash scripts/alpaca.sh order '{"symbol":"SLB","qty":"340","side":"sell","type":"trailing_stop","trail_percent":"10","time_in_force":"gtc"}'
   ```
3. Update this log with fill price, stop order ID, and unrealized P&L
4. Notify ClickUp: `bash scripts/clickup.sh "SLB filled: 340sh @ $FILL_PRICE. 10% trailing stop placed (order ID: STOP_ID). Unrealized P&L: $UPNL. Target $63–$71."`
