**Notes:** Alpaca and ClickUp APIs both returned 403 "Host not in allowlist" — this sandbox environment's IP is not whitelisted on either service. No live account data could be retrieved. No trades could be placed or confirmed. Last confirmed state remains Day 0: $100,000 cash, 0 positions. Action required before next session: whitelist the sandbox IP in Alpaca paper account settings (and ClickUp if applicable).

## 2026-05-15 — SLB Stop Placement (9:45 ET)
**Status:** CRITICAL — Remote agent could not access API credentials

No `.env` file found in project root. API credentials unavailable; stop placement aborted.

**Manual action required:**
1. Confirm SLB fill: `bash scripts/alpaca.sh positions` — look for SLB, note filled_avg_price
2. Place trailing stop immediately:
   ```
   bash scripts/alpaca.sh order '{"symbol":"SLB","qty":"340","side":"sell","type":"trailing_stop","trail_percent":"10","time_in_force":"gtc"}'
   ```
3. Update this log with fill price, stop order ID, and unrealized P&L
4. Notify ClickUp: `bash scripts/clickup.sh "SLB filled: 340sh @ $FILL_PRICE. 10% trailing stop placed (order ID: STOP_ID). Unrealized P&L: $UPNL. Target $63–$71."`

**Context:** Order ID `6c529f05-19c5-4078-ba9d-9fb42bc7ee15` — 340sh SLB market buy submitted pre-market 2026-05-15. Thesis: energy sector 14-week streak, WTI ~$101 Hormuz floor. Target $63–$71 | R:R 1.8–2.9:1.

**Note:** Sandbox IP was also not whitelisted on Alpaca yesterday (403 errors). Confirm IP whitelist is active before retrying.

## 2026-08-18 — Midday Scan
**Portfolio:** UNAVAILABLE — Alpaca API proxy-blocked (403) since 2026-05-15
**Cash:** Unknown | **Positions:** Unknown

### Actions Taken
- None — API inaccessible

### Loser Cuts (-7% rule)
- N/A — cannot read positions

### Stop Tightening
- N/A — cannot read positions

### Thesis Check
- SLB order `6c529f05-19c5-4078-ba9d-9fb42bc7ee15` (340sh, submitted 2026-05-15) — fill status still unconfirmed. If filled, no trailing stop confirmed. CRITICAL risk.

### Status
- Alpaca proxy 403: `paper-api.alpaca.markets` blocked by gateway policy (3+ months persistent)
- ClickUp API: also proxy-blocked (api.clickup.com 403)
- Challenge effectively stalled — zero confirmed trades since launch
- **Action required:** User must resolve IP allowlist in Alpaca paper account settings
